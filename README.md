ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @chan2git

I'm a Security/IT enthusiast striving to level up in coding/scripting, learning the art of code deployment, and exploring the realms of IT and security engineering. Github is the living record of my self-learning studies, filled with dynamic explorations of coding, deploying, and securing my path ahead!
